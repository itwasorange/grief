  <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1rem;">I am a wounded animal and I am begging you to hear my scream<br>
  Please slow down and take 5min of your day to give me a voice</p> 
</div>

<p>I am not good with words<br>
They have always been something I struggle with</p>

<p>Why does it have to be like that?<br>
The words only coming after they left</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>I didn't know her for very long<br>
Six days spread over a few months<br>
But every time it was just the two of us<br>
Her name was Ai, but it was pronounced Ao</p>

<p>Ao like the sound of pain</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>Our time together was full of conversation</p>

<p>We talked about programming and art<br>
We talked about the games we wanted to play<br>
The games we wanted to make</p>

<p>We talked about gender and I felt safe</p>

<p>We talked about philosophy and consciousness<br>
We talked about science and math<br>
We talked about religion and hell</p>

<p>She made me want to believe</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>She told me she wrote and I wanted to read it<br>
She said it was hard and painful to write<br>
That is how this feels</p>

<p>I told her I struggle with words but she made me want to struggle<br>
She made me want to learn<br>
We talked about language together<br>
Mandarin and Japanese<br>
Ai is love in both languages</p>

<p>Ai</p>

<p>She made me want to speak<br>
I will speak</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>I can still see her<br>
Her smile<br>
Her kindness</p>

<p>I see the long flowy dress she wore after prayer<br>
The red scarf</p>

<p>I can see her cool black jacket<br>
Her glow-in-the-dark lightsaber earrings</p>

<p>I see hoops and gold chains<br>
That short blond hair<br>
Her imperfect skin</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>I still feel the rock we climbed together<br>
The sound of the frogs we listened to<br>
I feel her little black cat's claws in my hands<br>
The musty smell of her apartment<br>
Her shelves of books</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>I can taste the meals we had together</p>

<p>The sandwiches that I couldn't finish<br>
The hotpot she bought for me, the taste of fish eggs<br>
The boba that came with a little plastic heart on top</p>

<p>I still have that little plastic heart</p>

<p>The chicken and rice that she cooked for me<br>
Sour but not sour</p>

<p>I remember the meal we didn't have<br>
I was flustered and couldn't get the order right<br>
She tried to comfort me with a hug but I didn't let her<br>
Why didn't I let her?</p>

<p>The Indian food outside my apartment we ate instead</p>

<p>The chicken and the chocolate shake</p>

<p>The oranges she peeled for me</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>In my phone she was a picture of an orange<br>
The first time we met, we talked about Priory of the Orange Tree<br>
A book about love</p>

<p>At her apartment there was this orange tree in the middle of the courtyard<br>
Large and overshadowing<br>
Dark and cool, it felt nice<br>
She loved that tree<br>
I remember how she climbed over the railing to pick fruit<br>
I was scared she would fall</p>

<p>The art I made for her was orange<br>
And when she left it was to Orange County for a job</p>

<p>Oranges and short blond hair</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>I think about all the things we said we would do together</p>

<p>More hikes, more games, more talks about philosophy and books<br>
We were going to play DND together<br>
A road trip to hike a mountain together<br>
A lightsaber fight that never happened</p>

<p>I wanted to go camping with her<br>
I wanted to tell her my trauma<br>
I wanted to say what I felt</p>

<p>Why does it have to be like that?<br>
The words only coming after they left</p>

<p>I wanted to tell her she was beautiful and strong<br>
I wanted to hold her</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>It was only six days together and some text messages</p>

<p>One date<br>
The hike I suggested as a second but wasn't<br>
The hike we climbed a rock together, the hotpot after<br>
Her apartment, the orange tree, the chicken she cooked<br>
My apartment, the failed order, the hug I didn't accept<br>
The movie</p>

<p>"Something's happening. I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more. And I know I shouldn't."</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>Why do I feel this so deeply?<br>
Now when I see the color orange, I think of her<br>
An entire color redefined by one person<br>
I am crying as I write these words</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>
  
<p>I think about how she just wanted to be friends after the first date<br>
I told her just being friends at the start was how I preferred to date<br>
But if she didn't feel the energy then that was ok<br>
She said that was what she was hoping I would say<br>
She was happy. I thought I could be too</p>

<p>I let her into my life</p>

<p>But she kept doing things that confused me</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>She asked me if I ever wanted to have kids<br>
She loved kids, she used to teach</p>

<p>I told her I had spent last christmas alone<br>
She offered for me to eat christmas dinner with her family<br>
She was so generous, it was only the second time we were together</p>

<p>The idea, the possibility<br>
Family..</p>

<p>I told her I drew gnomes, I showed her my art and she said they were cute<br>
She sent me the movie poster for Gnomeo and Juliet</p>

<p>Every time we met she complimented my shirts<br>
She said I was smart and talented</p>

<p>We talked about exercising,<br>
about our bodies<br>
She wanted muscly shoulders<br>
I wanted abs</p>

<p>She sent me her Henna and I told her it was pretty<br>
"ðŸ¥°"</p>

<p>She bought me dinner,<br>
and drove me around<br>
She tried to comfort me,<br>
and she cooked for me</p>

<p>She took me to see her favorite movie</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>Credits roll<br>
I glanced over<br>
She was wiping tears from her eyes<br>
That's when I fell</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>It all got twisted up<br>
She said she just wanted to be friends so I held back</p>

<p>But she was doing so much for me<br>
Six days over a couple months and she had already done so much<br>
I needed to do something for her</p>

<p>I draw<br>
So I drew</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>I wanted her to know what I was feeling without words<br>
I'm not good with words</p>

<p>I wanted her to see it<br>
I wanted her to see me<br>
I wanted to give it to her and tell her how I felt<br>
It was all I could think to do</p>

<p>I never got the chance to give it to her in person<br>
I still have it</p>

<p>I drew her favorite scene<br>
She didn't need to tell me</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>Anakin and Obi Wan fighting on Mustafar<br>
Lava splashing<br>
Smoke rising<br>
Fire and passion<br>
An eclipse shining through the smoke, an eye<br>
Orange</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>When I was drawing, it was all I could do<br>
I was emotional, I was stressed, I was so very deeply scared<br>
Work was too much, the world was collapsing<br>
Our identities were under attack</p>

<p>She was Muslim<br>
I am Trans<br>
She liked girls,<br>
and somehow I wasn't enough</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>I sent her the drawing over text<br>
She loved it<br>
Said it was her favorite scene</p>

<p>I knew<br>
She didn't need to tell me</p>

<p>I needed to tell her</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>But it went badly<br>
She said she treated all her friends like that<br>
"If that is how she treats friends.."</p>

<p>So I hid away for weeks</p>

<p>Then I told her "no I was mistaken, please can we still be friends"<br>
The unspoken "please don't leave me"<br>
She said yes</p>

<p>But she still left and I couldn't see her<br>
She left for Orange County<br>
It felt like she was disappearing from my life</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>It was repeating<br>
The 3rd time<br>
My life's pain in a loop</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>Things were slipping<br>
I needed to give her my art<br>
I offered to take the train down to see her<br>
She had been doing so much for me, I wanted to do something for her</p>

<p>She was excited, she thanked me for offering to come<br>
She said we could ride a ferris wheel together<br>
I told her I wanted to see her<br>
It felt like a whisper<br>
She said "yes it'll be fun :)"</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>But then she changed her mind</p>

<p>I told her I wanted to say what I was feeling in person<br>
And she left for good</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>I told her about my fears.<br>
I told her about my dad.<br>
I told her about my best friend and the hospital and the seizure.<br>
I said things I shouldn't have said at the end.<br>
I wanted to tell her more.</p>

<p>And now I won't be able to say anything to her again</p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>Can you feel it?<br>
Even a little?<br>
Can you feel what I am feeling?</p>

<p>These words<br>
Can you become more human if I speak them?<br>
Can you feel it through me?<br>
The shape of it?</p>

<p>Do I need to write the word for you to know what I felt?<br>
The color of that emotion?</p>

<p><strong>It was orange</strong></p>

<div class="dash">â€”</div>

<p>Six days...<br>
That's all it took<br>
It's Pride Month but all I feel is grief</p>
